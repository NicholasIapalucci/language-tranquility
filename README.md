# Language-Tranquility
The `language-tranquility` extension for Visual Studio Code provides language support for the Tranquility language developed at Drexel University by Professor Brian Stuart. Compilation is only accessible to Drexel students that can connect to the remote server at `usr123@tux.cs.drexel.edu`.

## Features
The extension ships with several features, including
 - Syntax highlighting
 - Documentation hovering
    - Docuentation for built-in functions
    - Documentation for reserved keywords
 - Linting
    - Errors
        - Unrecognized token type
        - Unexpected token type
        - Referencing an variable that is not defined
        - Referencing a variable that has not been assigned
        - Duplicate identifier names (including naming a function to the name of a built-in function)
        - Calling a function with the incorrect number of arguments
    - Warnings
        - Unused variables

## Windows Setup

### Newlines
If you are on Windows, you will need to ensure your new lines do not include carriage returns. On MacOS and Linux, new lines are written as `\n`, but on Windows they include a carriage return and are coded as `\r\n`. The Tranquility compiler is written in Linux and unlike most languages does not ignore new lines, and specifically expects `\n` characters. To set newlines to only `\n` in Visual Studio Code:
- Navigate to `%appdata% > Code > User > settings.json`
- Enter the following line in the top-level of the file:
```json
{
    ...
    "files.eol": "\n",
    ...
}
```
Visual Studio Code will now process new lines as `\n`. This is necessary to write Tranquility code. If you're in an existing project that had carriage returns by default, press the `CRLF` button in the bottom right of the window and switch to `LF`.

### Compilation
Compiling Tranquility is only possible on a Linux machine. To compile tranquility on windows, it is most common to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). Start by [installing WSL](https://aka.ms/wslstore). 

Next, NodeJS and the `wget` command need to be installed:

```bash
>> wsl
$ cd ~
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ sudo apt-get install wget
```

Next, the Tranquility run command must be registered. Download `setup.bash` and place it anywhere. In the location of the setup file, open CMD or Powershell, run `wsl` to enter WSL, and run `bash ./setup.bash`. This will download all of the necessary scripts; Specifically the tranquility compiler, MTVM, and the tranquility runner.

## Usage
Run `tranquility <filename>.t`.
